# AutoSecAI
AI-powered cloud security automation platform for threat detection, risk prediction, and auto-remediation.
This is a beginner level project to learn how AI can be used in cybersecurity.

The idea of this project is to slowly build a system that can:
- scan targets
- detect basic security issues
- analyze risk
- and give simple security responses

This project is for learning:
- Python
- AI basics
- cybersecurity concepts
- automation
- DevSecOps basics

## Why I started this project
I am a student in cybersecurity and digital science.
I want to build real projects while learning instead of only doing theory.

This repo will grow step by step as I learn new things.

## Tech (learning stage)
- Python
- FastAPI (later)
- AI concepts
- security basics

Status: Learning + Building phase
